## Welcome to OpenSimHub

| ![Logo](img/logo.svg) |A platform for open-source simulation projects developed by research groups and students of the [University of South-Eastern Norway](https://www.usn.no).<br>|


### Current Projects
- [**SysOpt**](https://sysopt.usn.no) This project aims to optimize the interface between power producers and grid owner by developing more efficient system services, thus ensuring operational security of the future energy system.
- [**FMIHydro**](FMIHydro.md) - Development of [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org) based models of Hydropower System components.
- [**OpenHPL**](https://openhpl.opensimhub.org) - open-source hydropower library that consists of hydropower unit models and is modelled using Modelica.

### Our Research Groups

- [**EPS**](https://www.usn.no/english/research/our-research-centres-and-groups/technology/electrical-power-systems/) - Electrical Power Systems Research Group
- [**AMOC**](https://www.usn.no/english/research/our-research-centres-and-groups/technology/applied-modeling-and-control/) - Applied Modeling and Control Research Group
